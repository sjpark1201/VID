# Viral Illness Detector (VID)

CLPS0950 Project II by Sean Park, Minchae Kim, and Wonjin Ko

This project involves utilizing both Python and PsychoPy to create a Python-based Viral Illness Detector (VID). VID diagnoses the most likely viral illness a patient may possess based on a questionnaire that evaluate a patient's symptoms. This project involves the following

     - creating a CSV file containing the symptoms each Viral Disease possesses and does not possess
     - converting the CSV dataset into a Pandas Dataframe 
     - converting Pandas Series and Dataframes into NumPy arrays and vector operations to make certain processeses easier 
     - using a set of conditional statements to assign, check, and diagnose a specific Viral Disease based on user symptoms
     - learning PsychoPy and implementing it into the program to create a user interactive interface 
     
Our project involves many concepts that we learned not only solely from Python but MATLAB. 

The project as a whole came together in the end, and we hope you enjoy!
